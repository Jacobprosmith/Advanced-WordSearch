School program, written in C++
The wc program is a UNIX utility that counts the numbers of lines, words, and characters in a text file.
In this assignment, I developed an enhanced wc program that not only counts the numbers of lines, words, and characters, but also collects (and outputs) the usage statistics of characters, words, and numbers in the file.
